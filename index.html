		<h2>Who I am</h2>
		<p>I am a graduate student at Syracuse University, where I compete in cross country and track and study Information Systems. Alongside my studies, I enjoy working on various coding projects, which have helped me to develop my skills and grow as a programmer. This portfolio showcases some of my most notable projects, which range from web applications to software tools. Whether you are an employer, a fellow student, or just someone who is interested in programming, I invite you to explore my portfolio and learn more about my work.</p>

				<h3>2022 NFL Season Analysis</h3>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="Project 1">
					<p>
						In my latest project, I analyzed NFL data from the 2022 season, specifically focusing on the comparison between offensive and defensive statistics. Using the programming language R, I was able to gather data from Pro Football Reference and create visualizations that allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the game.

						If you're interested in learning more about this project and how I completed it, be sure to check out my project page. There, you'll find a more detailed breakdown of my methodology and results, as well as the code I used to conduct the analysis.
