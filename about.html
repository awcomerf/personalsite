			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hi there, my name is Alex Comerford, and I'm originally from a small town in Michigan called Otsego. As a high schooler, I knew I wanted to pursue my passion for running track and cross country at the college level, so I made the decision to move to Syracuse and compete for Syracuse University. It was a big change, but I was excited to be part of such a great program and to be in a new city. </p>
			<p>
			While in school, I discovered a new passion: data analytics. I had always been interested in numbers and statistics, but it wasn't until I took a course in applied data analytics that I realized how much I loved working with data and using it to gain insights. I decided to major in applied data analytics and completed my undergraduate degree with that focus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, I'm pursuing a master's degree in information systems, and my passion for data analytics continues to grow. But what really excites me is using data analytics in the context of sports. I've always been a huge sports fan, and I love the idea of using data to gain insights into athletes' performance, team strategy, and more.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's why the majority of the projects I post on my website are related to sports and data science in some way. I'm always looking for new ways to apply my skills and knowledge to the world of sports, and I love sharing my findings with others. So if you're interested in sports and data science, you've come to the right place!
